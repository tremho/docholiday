## Rendering Differences

Different rendering engines and different options can sometimes produce
unexpected results.

If your resulting documentation is missing information, or mis-formatting it in some
way, you may want to try a different rendering engine or a different
style template.

##### Issues with Markdown rendering with j2doc2md
The following items may not appear correctly in your Markdown output
if you have chosen to use 'jsdoc' for your 'engine' configuration setting:

###### Multiple Types
Multiple type declarations for a parameter or return, such as
`string|number|undefined` may not be correctly represented in the
Markdown.  This may appear as `string `\  instead.

###### Array types
An array type that should display as `Array<type>` may appear in a mangled
form, such as `Array.&lt;type&gt;`

###### Other cases of improper XML escapes or quotes
Unwanted XML escapes, such as &quote; or &lt; or &gt; may appear around constant declarations, 
or strings may be represented with an unneccesary extra set of quote marks, such as `'"this is a string"'`
because the jsdoc2md escape handler may be rendering these types improperly.

###### Default `new Class()` and arrays in properties
Declaring a class property with a default value, where the
default value uses the `new` keyword will display incorrectly with the default
value of `new` and the class name in the description.

Also, a class property declared with `[]` or other literal array as the 
default value will also display incorrectly in a similar manner.

_This occurs with JSDoc HTML output as well and is not limited to the 
jsdoc2md behavior_


#### Use Documentation JS
Consider using Documentation JS (engine: 'docjs') if you have problems like the ones
listed above, since this engine outputs to markdown without these issues.

Alternately, you may be able to find templates that
