# Doc Holiday

If your documentation pipeline goes earp a bit too much,
and you need to make it O.K., corral your documentation backlog and 
take a break from disappointing documentation generation

A JSDoc source block re-generator targeting Typescript

### Goals
- generates normalized JSDoc comment blocks from un-normalized
source with some additional features
- parse existing jsdoc or simple comment forms
- parse typescript type info
- support side-comments
- produce analysis json detailing commented items and source details
- produce stub-only output for documentation generation only
- <del>produce normalized version attached to original code</del>
- <del>can update source in-place or by copy</del>
- designed to process Typescript, but also helps Javascript
- normalize ts types into jsdoc parameters / return
- support side-comments
- support special block formatting (e.g. plantUML)
- support documentation construction

----------

#### End game

In the closing phase...(I think).... just need to finish the following:

- [X] html,markdown both
- [X] Tests and approved comps
- [ ] Manual test config options
  - [X] jsdoc, no template
  - [X] jsdoc, with template
  - [X] docjs
  
  - <del>- [ ] tsdoc (_still need to install_)</del>   
  - Turns out ts-doc is not a cli app like jsdoc or docjs. It's a parser library
  
  - [X] remove tsdoc config options

- [X] @throw
- [X] tweaks from blog to markdown (Kevin Bridges https://medium.com/@kevinast/integrate-gitbook-jsdoc-974be8df6fb3
  )
- <del>[ ] attribution hack?</del>

_Able to generate self-doc. Need to write the docs.  
I should re-export  
Also, do a test of module import and make sure we don't execute  
Add verbosity logger and do a console sweep_


- [X] make cli and do npm private publish
- [X] temp link of global to build/index.js for dev test
- [X] use ansi colors for help display
- <del>[ ] add a verbosity option (0 - 3) default 0</del> 
- [X] (rev) cli defaults and process detection
- [X] ignore shebang line when parsing module description
- [X] use to self-document
- [ ] fix issues below
- [ ] put to travis
- [ ] add badges for readme
- [ ] use to document jove
- [ ] public publish to npm

### Issues

- [X] --analysis cli option is not working

- [X] Mix In is not recognized; does not work
  - current focus example is set for the MDN case. Debug from here.

- [ ] Constraints not working (see focus)
- [ ] document TypeCheck and show practical use of runtime

- [X] go src/** works as expected
- [X] API docs look right
  - NB: Multiple types with | renders okay in html but not markdown
  - NB: ditto for string[] (Array<string>)
  - NB: property defaults with new, [] do not render correctly in markdown
  - Note: All nb items above not present under docJS 
  

- [X] executeCommand parmeters not represented properly
  - goes awry at cmd='', somehow picked up the words process and set
  

- [X] Refactor to be more Github Pages friendly.
  - change html output to docs/html
  - get rid of docs/ test
  - change booksrc to docs
  - Rewrite the whole publishing section to discuss github pages
  - mention other methods without explicit how to.



- [X] 'Biorhythm' example in intro doesn't really work as advertised
  - parameters mangled
  - return type wrong
  - multi-line comment has // 
  - hbs template is inserting &lt;code&gt; and &lt;p&gt; tags

- [X] we should have a sort (true/false) option we can honor
  in our plugin (default: false == use our intercept)
- [X] console logs for execute and plugin intercept should be removed

- [X] Commented SourceReader is failing.  Out of sync in private functions
past GatherCommentMeta -- inside `readCommentBlockForm1` is picking up
`clean` and `lns` and treating as properties outside of class -- and whack.

- [X] also in SourceReader -- multiline comment for comments property was failing.


- [X] create CLI options for 
  - just make stubs
  - just render stubs
  - just make collection and output as JSON
- [ ] add CLI docs


----
##### Issues documenting our sources

- [ ] TypeCheck~TypeConstraint - bad docs for [name] and constructor

- [ ] jsdoc block dash ( - ) in parameter descriptions should be ignored `TypeCheck~parseConstraints`

- [ ] types are not linking.

- [ ] support line spacing options (end with period or cap next, deliberate line)

- [ ] see if we can mitigate the problem with spaces in a default value `new ScopeModifiers()`.
_I believe this is a jsdoc rendering issue_

- [ ] callbacks are not representing parameter and return info (any info)

- [ ] SpecificationStatus is a misnomer for this context. Remove jsdoc form errors. maybe note the block type.

- [ ] Ignore any number of sequential - or * at start of comment lines


----
###### Can live with for now

- [ ] (properties) multi-value assignment provides incorrect default and type


-----------

##### Fixed

- [X] enum bug case lack of comma on last element fails to read value
- [X] enum key strings redundant value comment 

- [X] assigned functions are marked private. need to commute modifiers before assignment
- [X] generators need * (and keyword?)
- [X] generator should support @yields 
- [X] generator should produce @yields from Generator or Iterator returns.
- [X] anonymous function not recognized - no stub

- [X] inline parameter comment fails if before comma
- [X] typescript form parameters fail if no space after comma
- 
- [X] ad-hoc parameter type not represented in JSDOC stub (collapses to object)
- [X] nested ad-hoc parameters fail big time
- [X] ad-hoc return type not represented in JSDOC stub (collapses to object)
- [X] ad-hoc return type also produces a property declaration with part of the ad-hoc statement
- 
- [X] void functions with return comments have no return tag or return comments
- [X] @throws tag is ignored
- 

###### If the template excludes private, like better-docs, it won't show
We _could_ have an `--all-public` flag that generates stubs ignoring private  
Defer this because this needs community input.

------------
##### Documentation types and test matrix

- [X] Complete for this stage 

###### Enum
- [X] implicit
- [X] explicit
- [X] mixed with explicit start after first
- [X] explicit out of order
- [X] strings
- [X] strings with key==value

- Do enums need to be scoped? Currently they are not.
- [X] No, but allow and ignore 'const' modifier

###### Functions
- [X] basic javascript type
- [X] separated lines
- [X] typescript - one line and split
- [X] assigned classic function - one line and split
- [X] assigned arrow function - one line and split
- [X] anonymous function
- [X] generator function recognized by *
- [X] async keyword

###### Parameters
- [X] name only, any type
- [X] name only with comment
- [X] name:type (typescript)
- [X] name:type with comment
- [X] name:{foo:string, bar:number} (ad-hoc type)
- [X] name:{foo:string, bar:number} (ad-hoc type) with comment

###### Returns
- [X] void
- [X] type
- [X] Promise
- [X] ad-hoc type
- [X] w/wo comment

- [X] Throws

- [X] Developed problem running test.  test-direct is okay, but test hangs. Generation is okay.

_not sure what's going on, but it seems to be at the 'returns' test.
docstub call may be what's failing.  
Hard to trace._

_It was source reader not advancing pos past a distended body.

###### module Properties
- [X] var, let, const 
- [X] w/wo assignment
- [X] top and side comments
- [X] declared public
- [X] multi dec behavior and workaround

###### Classes
- [X] Functions and parameters
- [X] Properties 
- [X] constructors
- [X] inner classes

---
- Inner class doc by listing props instead of creating stubs seems to work
- Findng other issues that are now in my way
- Can't verify items marked -
- [-] comments that do not start at column zero may not be getting skipped
- [-] Second property definition in class is screwy
- [-] a split method param list gives us an extra empty param
- [X] class prop without type is a problem
- [X] (above) was case of 'type' keyword initiated a bogus typedef parse
- [X] should show default value on initialized class prop
- [X] show modifiers on properties

√ _NEED TO WRITE TESTS FOR THESE ITEMS_


###### JSDOC meta
- [X] params
- [X] return
- [X] {{{ }}} custom
    - [X] jsdoc tag
    - [X] plant UML

###### Use of semicolons
- [X] line endings
- [X] within one line
- [x] all element types
