# Doc Holiday

If your documentation pipeline goes earp a bit too much,
and you need to make it O.K., corral your documentation backlog and 
take a break from disappointing documentation generation

A JSDoc source block re-generator targeting Typescript

### Goals
- generates normalized JSDoc comment blocks from un-normalized
source with some additional features
- parse existing jsdoc or simple comment forms
- parse typescript type info
- support side-comments
- produce analysis json detailing commented items and source details
- produce stub-only output for documentation generation only
- <del>produce normalized version attached to original code</del>
- <del>can update source in-place or by copy</del>
- designed to process Typescript, but also helps Javascript
- normalize ts types into jsdoc parameters / return
- support side-comments
- support special block formatting (e.g. plantUML)
- support documentation construction

----------

#### End game

In the closing phase...(I think).... just need to finish the following:

- [X] html,markdown both
- [X] Tests and approved comps
- [ ] Manual test config options
  - [X] jsdoc, no template
  - [X] jsdoc, with template
  - [X] docjs
  
  - <del>- [ ] tsdoc (_still need to install_)</del>   
  - Turns out ts-doc is not a cli app like jsdoc or docjs. It's a parser library
  
  - [ ] remove tsdoc config options

- [X] @throw
- [ ] tweaks from blog to markdown
- [ ] attribution hack?
- [ ] self-document

-----------

### Issues

----
###### Can live with for now

- [ ] (properties) multi-value assignment provides incorrect default and type

-----------

##### Fixed

- [X] enum bug case lack of comma on last element fails to read value
- [X] enum key strings redundant value comment 

- [X] assigned functions are marked private. need to commute modifiers before assignment
- [X] generators need * (and keyword?)
- [X] generator should support @yields 
- [X] generator should produce @yields from Generator or Iterator returns.
- [X] anonymous function not recognized - no stub

- [X] inline parameter comment fails if before comma
- [X] typescript form parameters fail if no space after comma
- 
- [X] ad-hoc parameter type not represented in JSDOC stub (collapses to object)
- [ ] nested ad-hoc parameters fail big time
- [X] ad-hoc return type not represented in JSDOC stub (collapses to object)
- [X] ad-hoc return type also produces a property declaration with part of the ad-hoc statement
- 
- [X] void functions with return comments have no return tag or return comments
- [X] @throws tag is ignored
- 

###### If the template excludes private, like better-docs, it won't show
We _could_ have an `--all-public` flag that generates stubs ignoring private  
Defer this because this needs community input.

------------
##### Documentation types and test matrix

- [X] Complete for this stage 

###### Enum
- [X] implicit
- [X] explicit
- [X] mixed with explicit start after first
- [X] explicit out of order
- [X] strings
- [X] strings with key==value

- Do enums need to be scoped? Currently they are not.
- [X] No, but allow and ignore 'const' modifier

###### Functions
- [X] basic javascript type
- [X] separated lines
- [X] typescript - one line and split
- [X] assigned classic function - one line and split
- [X] assigned arrow function - one line and split
- [X] anonymous function
- [X] generator function recognized by *
- [X] async keyword

###### Parameters
- [X] name only, any type
- [X] name only with comment
- [X] name:type (typescript)
- [X] name:type with comment
- [X] name:{foo:string, bar:number} (ad-hoc type)
- [X] name:{foo:string, bar:number} (ad-hoc type) with comment

###### Returns
- [X] void
- [X] type
- [X] Promise
- [X] ad-hoc type
- [X] w/wo comment

- [X] Throws

- [X] Developed problem running test.  test-direct is okay, but test hangs. Generation is okay.

_not sure what's going on, but it seems to be at the 'returns' test.
docstub call may be what's failing.  
Hard to trace._

_It was source reader not advancing pos past a distended body.

###### module Properties
- [X] var, let, const 
- [X] w/wo assignment
- [X] top and side comments
- [X] declared public
- [X] multi dec behavior and workaround

###### Classes
- [X] Functions and parameters
- [X] Properties 
- [X] constructors
- [X] inner classes

---
- Inner class doc by listing props instead of creating stubs seems to work
- Findng other issues that are now in my way
- Can't verify items marked -
- [-] comments that do not start at column zero may not be getting skipped
- [-] Second property definition in class is screwy
- [-] a split method param list gives us an extra empty param
- [X] class prop without type is a problem
- [X] (above) was case of 'type' keyword initiated a bogus typedef parse
- [X] should show default value on initialized class prop
- [X] show modifiers on properties

âˆš _NEED TO WRITE TESTS FOR THESE ITEMS_


###### JSDOC meta
- [X] params
- [X] return
- [X] {{{ }}} custom
    - [X] jsdoc tag
    - [X] plant UML

###### Use of semicolons
- [X] line endings
- [X] within one line
- [x] all element types
